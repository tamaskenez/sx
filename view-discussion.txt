How to declare view to const content:
1. it's always const, there's no view to mutable content
2. view<const T>
3. const view<T>

Shallow compare: how to compare views (if they refer the same memory)
1. not possible
2. operator==
3. named function (e.g. is_same_view(view1, view2))

Deep compare: how to compare content:
1. with external code (std::equal)
2. operator==
3. named function (e.g. deep_equals(view1, view2))

Deep per-item compare of two identically sized views (returns bool array)
1. with external code
2. operator==
3. named function

Shallow copy (reassign view)
1. not possible
2. operator=
3. named function

Deep copy
1. with external code
2. operator=
3. named function
