N4494 rev 6 https://isocpp.org/files/papers/N4494.html
Rephrased coord.general avoid references to mathematical entites.
Renamed index to offset.
Changed int Rank template parameter to size_t Rank throughout the document.
Made offset, bounds and bounds_iterator binary operators (apart from @= forms) free functions.
Replaced term "component" with "element" when referring to the individual constituents of offset or bounds.
In coord.bounds.require replaced prose with an equivalent mathematical expression.
In coord.bounds.iterator and coord.bounds.iterator.require removed the requirement on bounds_iterator to represent a random access iterator, replacing with "as-if" phrasing.
In the description of bounds_iterator& operator++() replaced the code snippet with equivalent prose.
In views.general changed the font back to non-monospace.
Removed views.require, duplicating it as arrayview.require and stridedarrayview.require.
Removed redundant assignment operators on array_view and strided_array_view.
Employed "exposition only" data members is the descriptions of array_view and strided_array_view semantics.
Rephrased the first paragraph in arrayview.cons to avoid ambiguity in binding of the token "type".
In constexpr array_view(Viewable&& vw) rephrased the third bullet point.
The following suggestion was implemented partially:

Instead of the array_view(ArrayType& arr) constructor being completely removed, it has been constrained to 1-D case as the Committee indicated that such case does not exhibit the undefined behavior. We believe that the request to remove it completely was a misstatment.

N4177 rev 4 http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4177.html
The order of some of the array_view and strided_array_view constructor parameters have been switched from {size, location} to {location, size} for consistency with the existing practice in STL (vide copy_n).

Alias templates for constant views have been introduced.
     // Views alias templates
      template <class T, int Rank = 1>
        using carray_view = array_view<const T, Rank>;
      template <class T, int Rank = 1>
        using cstrided_array_view = strided_array_view<const T, Rank>;

-
    1. iterating over just the first dimension;
     2. iterating over a flat view of all of the elements
- data()
- more slicing
- unify array_view and strided array view
- bounds and index separate types
- bounds and index could be array
- to provide data(), iterators()
- position iterator should be able to extend: col-major, row-major, linear iteration, morton
- operator()
- N4355 style ordering tag
- iteration, slicing indep of ordering
- random access container
